## RebelCoin
---

This is like the almost exact copy of Xavier Decuyper's very simple blockchain implementation in Javascript - [SavjeeCoin](https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin), only, this is written purely in Python..


It still has some errors and kinks to work on so it doesnt work exactly like SavjeeCoin, but it was a good test for me to see if I could do it or not.

Like SavjeeCoin, I also made a frontend demo for this [here](https://github.com/anorebel/RebelCoin-frontend), written in Python too using Flask.

### Features
---
- Simple proof-of-work algorithm
- Verify blockchain (to prevent tampering)
- Generate wallet (private/public key)
- Sign transactions


#### TODO
---
[ ] Add Tests
